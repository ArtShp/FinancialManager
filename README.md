### Setup a DB connection
First you need to open or create a database (further: DB).

**Warning**: You should use **only** DBs created in this app! Otherwise, the correct operation of the application is **not** guaranteed!

#### Create a new DB
If you want to create a new DB, open file menu (in the menu strip), find the button "Create DB" and press on it (or use a shortcut *Ctrl+N*). Then choose a folder where to store your DB, choose a name for it and finally press "Save". If everything is ok, you'll see a successful message. But then you'll immediately see an error message: about it later.
